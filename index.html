<h3>About</h3>
I'm trained in computer science and psychology, with 4+ years of experience developing software for research and enterprise. I'm presently most interested in the human ecology of environmental crisis mitigation/adaptation. Other interests include:
<ul>
    <li>Applied mathematics (category theory, linear control systems)</li>
    <li>Data visualization</li>
    <li>Linguistics/literature</li>
    <li>Philosophy of science</li>
    <li>Social/cognitive psychology and cognitive science</li>
</ul>
<h3>Blog</h3>
<p>I write things here sometimes. Usually I have no relevant qualifications to do so. Please don't hesitate to point out why I'm obviously mistaken and I'll do my best to fix it.</p>
<p><a href="http://dismagazine.com/disillusioned/discussion-disillusioned/68280/hans-ulrich-obrist-timothy-morton/">Morton suggests</a> we think social systems like toys: things to play with, share with one another (not fight over), and which we may grow out of at some point ("there's no one toy to rule them all"). I like to think words this way. All appearing here are artifacts of an ongoing process and ought never be considered definitive.</p>
