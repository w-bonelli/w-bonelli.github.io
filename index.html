<h3>About</h3>
I'm an IT professional trained in computer science and psychology, with 4+ years of experience developing software for research and enterprise. I'm presently most interested in the philosophy, psychology, and praxis of human ecology in the context of environmental crisis mitigation/adaptation. Other interests include:
<ul>
    <li>Applied mathematics (category theory, linear control systems)</li>
    <li>Data visualization</li>
    <li>Linguistics/literature/semiotics</li>
    <li>Philosophy of science</li>
    <li>Social/cognitive psychology and cognitive science</li>
</ul>
I write things here sometimes. Usually I have no relevant qualifications to do so. Please don't hesitate to point out why I'm obviously mistaken and I'll do my best to fix it.

<h3>Blog</h3>
<p><a href="http://dismagazine.com/disillusioned/discussion-disillusioned/68280/hans-ulrich-obrist-timothy-morton/">Morton suggests</a> we think human-in-the-loop systems like toys: things to play with, share with one another (not kill one another over), and which we may grow out of at some point ("there's no one toy to rule them all"). I like to think words this way. All appearing here are artifacts of an ongoing process and ought not be considered complete or definitive (though I will make clear if/when something has been edited retroactively).</p>
