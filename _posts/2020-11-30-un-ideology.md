> Ideology is a sick fetish.[^1]

Here is expressed un ideology, which is of course a contradiction.

He who was before all else a revolutionist wrote:

> The philosophers have only interpreted the world... the point, however, is to change it.[^2]

Indeed. The nib of a pen, suffusing the [remains of an animal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parchment) with the [remains of a vegetable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_gall_ink), can hardly do otherwise. I take issue only with "only".

Ballpoints and blockchains engender balmier revolutions than bombs and bayonets. Whether this constitutes an improvement is disputed. To Calasso, the

> invisible, imperceptible sun of political action [is now] not to impede or foster... convulsions... but rather to *soften the blow*, to coat the sharp edges in sweet essence of balm... [and] above all to... refuse to credit them with that *extra something* which they always claim to represent &mdash; to refuse to believe, in short, that a massacre can easily be transformed into a sacrifice.[^3]

Bombs still drop, of course; but only elsewhere. Perhaps predictably, the most militant revolutionaries tend to hail from elsewhere.
