title: whatever really
---

> The relations that exist in the external world, and that govern their succession, collectively constitute what we call causality. Without a belief in causal order, there could be no science and, very probably, no sanity.[^1]

> Science must answer... "Why?"; it must say, "Because"... there are *different* and *inequivalent*, but equally valid, ways of saying "because".[^1]

There appears to be some measure of order in the universe. Whether this is a timeless quality or a temporary aberration, we do not know. Nonetheless science presupposes signals in the noise around us. Phenomena, it seems, can be predicted. To predict, we model — we represent. Informed thusly, we act. We hope our models correspond to whatever really is there; to whatever there really is. But what *is* there, really? Can we know? And how ought we model it?

Some schools of thought assert that the world is exclusively [physical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism). Interpretations are complex, but there does seem to be a common thread &mdash; one of [Mazur's super-objects](http://abel.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/preprints/when_is_one.pdf), folded around its particular subject matter so tightly that, much like the extra-dimensional compactification physicists propose, we may not notice it.

But Cartwright cautions:

> “The fundamental laws of physics do not describe true facts about reality. Rendered as descriptions of facts, they are false; amended to be true, they lose... explanatory force.”[^2]

Is the reductionist mode of (re)presentation best taken as epistemological tool or ontological truth? Ought biological research programs close ranks, as many did[^3] and some continue to do, around the idea that biology is strictly reducible to its substrata? Or should we attempt to coax useful predictions from any ground fertile enough to offer them?

Without doubt some measure of physicalism remains indispensable. Deacon reminds:

> “...although the abstract logic of natural selection may be multiply realizable, selection is dependent upon substrate properties and how they influence form generation.”[^4]

A healthy respect for the more obvious qualities of everyday objects in Euclidean 3-space — continuity, smoothness, volume exclusion — must underly morphological models. And Turing[^5] and Wolpert[^6] established half a century ago that chemical processes — reaction-diffusion systems and morphogen gradients, respectively — explain a number of developmental patterns. But no modern molecular biologist denies that the graph, despite its abstract nature, aids the study of transcriptional gene regulation. Physicists admit that we do not live in Newton’s universe. Matter manifests just one fragment of the kaleidoscope of causality. Downward causation, to Heylighen, occurs when

> "the higher level exerts its influence downward to the lower level [and] is to be contrasted with... reductionism, where the behavior of the whole is fully determined by the behavior of the parts."[^7]

Sometimes, as Hofstadter puts it,

> “the bottom level, though 100 percent responsible for what is happening, is nonetheless irrelevant to what happens.”[^8]

Information is physical, claims Landauer: it is subject to physical constraints.[^9] Likewise, the physical systems we call living organisms are subject to informational constraints. The fundamental unit of terrestrial biology — which, as Bach[^10] and Brenner[^11] point out, looks quite like a self-replicating Turing machine, replete with read/write head and finite tape — is a vector for simultaneous spatial and temporal information transfer. Although plant cell identity seems primarily a result of location rather than lineage, Scheres reports:

> “...ancestral or neighboring cells can determine the fate of a given cell.”[^12]

Rosen says the *future* can too, by virtue of the cell’s internal model of its environment (a very primitive one, to be clear, but one which has proven remarkably resilient):

> “...a predictive model serves precisely to pull the future into the present.”[^1]

To stand McLuhan[^13] on his head: maybe the message has hijacked the medium, encoding a strategy for self-regulation and self-replication via exploitation of negentropy. Or maybe that's not right and some model nobody has conceived of yet would better serve us. Some derivations, which seem possible in principle or in the presence of privileged information, may remain infeasible simply due to insufficiently developed methods; Jonas and Kording, for instance, have shown modern neuroscience incapable of deriving the global function of a microprocessor from its underlying physical and logical structure.[^14] But some models, despite yielding equally useful (if not equal) results, may truly be impossible to reconcile by any formal means.
