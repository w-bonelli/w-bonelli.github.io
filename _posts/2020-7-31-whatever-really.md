title: whatever really
---

> The relations that exist in the external world, and that govern their succession, collectively constitute what we call causality. Without a belief in causal order, there could be no science and, very probably, no sanity.[^1]

There is, by all accounts, some measure of order in the world. Whether this is a universal quality or a local aberration, we do not know. Nonetheless the success of the institution called science is a testament to the fact that there are signals in the noise around us. Phenomena, it seems, can be predicted. To predict, we model — that is, we represent. Informed thusly, we act. We hope our models correspond, in some useful way, to whatever is really there; to whatever there really is. But what is there, really? Can we know? And how best ought we model it?

It is one thing for predictions made by two models to comport with one another. It is a different thing entirely to *derive* one model from the other. Must there exist some conceptual framework from which all else, in the broadest sense, can be deduced from first principles? One school of thought answers in the affirmative, positing that the world is exclusively *physical* &mdash; that is, that all things may find satisfactory causal explanation in the states, motions, and collective configurations of *objects* called particles. This is a *super-object*, folded around its particular subject so tightly that, much like the extra-dimensional compactification physicists propose, we may not notice it. But Cartwright cautions:

> “The fundamental laws of physics do not describe true facts about reality. Rendered as descriptions of facts, they are false; amended to be true, they lose... explanatory force.”[^2]

Should we really construe the physical *mode of presentation* not merely as an epistemological tool, but as an ontological truth? Ought biological research programs close ranks around &mdash; that is, adopt as a Lakatosian "hard core" &mdash; the idea that biology is strictly reducible to chemistry and physics? Or should we attempt to coax useful predictions from any ground appearing sufficiently fertile to offer them? Can biology really be understood exclusively in terms of its substrata?

Without doubt some measure of physicalism does remain indispensable to biological science. Deacon reminds us:

> “...although the abstract logic of natural selection may be multiply realizable, selection is dependent upon substrate properties and how they influence form generation.”[^3]

A healthy respect for the quotidian qualities of everyday 3-dimensional space — continuity, smoothness, volume exclusion — must underly morphological models. Turing[^4] and Wolpert[^5] established half a century ago that chemical processes — reaction-diffusion systems and morphogen gradients, respectively — explain a number of developmental patterns. Yet no modern molecular biologist denies that the graph, despite its abstract nature, is useful in the study of transcriptional gene regulation. Physicists admit that we do not live in Newton’s universe. Matter, it seems, manifests just one fragment of the kaleidoscope of causality. Sometimes, as Hofstadter puts it:

> “...the bottom level, though 100 percent responsible for what is happening, is nonetheless irrelevant to what happens.”[^6]

Information is physical, claims Landauer: it is subject to physical constraints.[^7] Likewise, the physical systems we call living organisms are subject to informational constraints. The fundamental unit of terrestrial biology — which, as Bach[^8] and Brenner[^9] point out, looks quite like a self-replicating Turing machine, replete with read/write head and finite tape — is a vector for simultaneous spatial and temporal information transfer. Although cell identity appears primarily a result of location rather than lineage, Scheres reports:

> “...ancestral or neighboring cells can determine the fate of a given cell.”[^10]

Rosen argues that the *future* can too, by virtue of the cell’s internal model of its environment (a primitive one which, to be clear, implies nothing approaching cognition). In this formulation,

> “...a predictive model serves precisely to pull the future into the present.”[^1]

To stand McLuhan[^11] on his head: perhaps the message has hijacked the medium, encoding a strategy for self-regulation and self-replication via exploitation of negentropy. Or maybe that's not quite right and some model nobody has conceived of yet would better serve us. Regardless, Brenner asserts,

> “at the core of everything are the tapes containing the descriptions to build these special Turing machines… The concept of the gene as a symbolic representation of the organism is a fundamental feature of the living world and must form the kernel of biological theory.”[^9]

This is not to say biology is nothing other than genetics, but merely that bespoke abstractions — which may not be derived easily, if at all, from strictly physical and chemical processes — have proven and will in all likelihood continue to prove useful to the modeling of biological systems. In some cases derivations may be possible in principle, but remain infeasible given the current state of the art, much in the same way Jonas and Kording demonstrated modern neuroscience incapable of deriving the global function of a microprocessor from its underlying physical and logical structure.[^12]

To Bach, Turing’s test is for us, not the machine.[^8] I agree. A constructivist mathematician will not accept the proof of some quantity until a function can be shown to yield it. Similarly, I think we will not understand life or intelligence until we can make it, if we can make it at all. In this way, the stated aims of synthetic biology and artificial intelligence appear to converge: to more and more elaborate manipulation, if not ultimately to synthesis, of living systems.

The former is often said to be untrodden territory, but it is not. The latter is. Many say both are dangerous. I wholeheartedly agree. I submit, however, that it is now more dangerous *not* to attempt the latter precisely because we have more or less unconsciously pursued the former for the last several thousand years.

This is not an enviable situation, but it is at least not a boring one.
