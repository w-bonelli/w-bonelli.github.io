title: whatever really
---

> The relations that exist in the external world, and that govern their succession, collectively constitute what we call causality. Without a belief in causal order, there could be no science and, very probably, no sanity.[^1]

There is, by all accounts, some measure of order in the universe. Whether this is a timeless quality or a temporary aberration, we do not know. Nonetheless the success of science is a testament to the fact that there are signals in the noise around us. Phenomena, it seems, can be predicted. To predict, we model — that is, we represent. Informed thusly, we act. We hope our models correspond, in some useful way, to whatever really is there; to whatever there really is. But what *is* there, really? Can we know? And how best ought we model it?

Some schools of thought assert that the world is exclusively [physical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism). It is not abundantly clear what exactly this means &mdash; it would be a gross oversimplification, for instance, to ascribe to all camps the view that all things may find satisfactory causal explanation in the states, motions, and collective configurations of particles &mdash; but there does seem to be a common thread: one of [Mazur's super-objects](http://abel.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/preprints/when_is_one.pdf), folded around its particular object so tightly that, much like the extra-dimensional compactification physicists propose, we may not notice it. But Cartwright cautions:

> “The fundamental laws of physics do not describe true facts about reality. Rendered as descriptions of facts, they are false; amended to be true, they lose... explanatory force.”[^2]

It is one thing for predictions made by two models to comport with one another. It is a different thing for a model to [supervene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervenience) on another, and another to [derive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_proof) one model from the other. Should we construe the physical mode of (re)presentation not merely as an epistemological tool, but as an ontological truth? Ought biological research programs close ranks, as many did [^3] and some continue to do, around the idea that biology is strictly reducible to chemistry and physics? Can biology be understood exclusively in terms of its substrata? Or should we attempt to coax useful predictions from any ground appearing sufficiently fertile to offer them?

Without doubt some measure of physicalism does remain indispensable to biological science. Deacon reminds us:

> “...although the abstract logic of natural selection may be multiply realizable, selection is dependent upon substrate properties and how they influence form generation.”[^4]

A healthy respect for the everyday qualities of Euclidean 3-space — continuity, smoothness, volume exclusion — must underly morphological models. Turing[^5] and Wolpert[^6] established half a century ago that chemical processes — reaction-diffusion systems and morphogen gradients, respectively — explain a number of developmental patterns. Yet no modern molecular biologist denies that the graph, despite its abstract nature, aids the study of transcriptional gene regulation. Physicists admit that we do not live in Newton’s universe. Matter, it seems, manifests just one fragment of the kaleidoscope of causality. Sometimes, as Hofstadter puts it:

> “...the bottom level, though 100 percent responsible for what is happening, is nonetheless irrelevant to what happens.”[^7]

Information is physical, claims Landauer: it is subject to physical constraints.[^8] Likewise, the physical systems we call living organisms are subject to informational constraints. The fundamental unit of terrestrial biology — which, as Bach[^9] and Brenner[^10] point out, looks quite like a self-replicating Turing machine, replete with read/write head and finite tape — is a vector for simultaneous spatial and temporal information transfer. Although plant cell identity seems primarily a result of location rather than lineage, Scheres reports:

> “...ancestral or neighboring cells can determine the fate of a given cell.”[^11]

Rosen argues that the *future* can too, by virtue of the cell’s internal model of its environment (a primitive one which, to be clear, implies nothing approaching cognition):

> “...a predictive model serves precisely to pull the future into the present.”[^1]

To stand McLuhan[^12] on his head: maybe the message has hijacked the medium, encoding a strategy for self-regulation and self-replication via exploitation of negentropy. Or maybe that's not quite right and some model nobody has conceived of yet would better serve us. Regardless, says Brenner,

> “at the core of everything are the tapes containing the descriptions to build these special Turing machines… The concept of the gene as a symbolic representation of the organism is a fundamental feature of the living world and must form the kernel of biological theory.”[^9]

This is not to say biology is nothing other than genetics, but merely that bespoke abstractions — which may not be extracted easily, if at all, from strictly physical and chemical processes — have proven and will in all likelihood continue to prove useful to the modeling of biological systems. In some cases derivations may be possible in principle, but remain infeasible given the current state of the art, in much the same way Jonas and Kording have shown modern neuroscience incapable of deriving the global function of a microprocessor from its underlying physical and logical structure.[^13]

To Bach, Turing’s test is for us, not the machine[^9]: we will not understand life or intelligence until we can make it, if we can make it at all. In this way, the stated aims of synthetic biology and artificial intelligence appear to converge: to more and more elaborate manipulation, if not ultimately to synthesis, of living systems.

The former is sometimes said to be untrodden territory. It is not. The latter is. Both are said to be dangerous. I wholeheartedly agree. But it may now be more dangerous *not* to pursue both, precisely because we have manipulated the biosphere with increasingly wild abandon for the last several hundred years.

This is not an enviable situation, but neither is it a boring one.
