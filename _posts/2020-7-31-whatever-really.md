title: whatever really
---

> Sensual things are elegies to the disappearance of objects.[^1]

By all accounts there is order in the universe. Shit can be predicted. To predict, we model. Informed, we act, hoping perhaps to God or Science that the model corresponds to whatever really is.

Some posit a solely [physical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism) universe. This is not an agnostic monism: atop it sits a metaphysics in which the for-itself &mdash; life, from primordial ooze to a biped behind a keyboard &mdash;

> has a biological (and thus mechanical) explanation.[^2]

This view is useful, in practical and scientific senses both, as it is intuitive. Deacon reminds that

> although the abstract logic of natural selection may be multiply realizable, selection is dependent upon substrate properties and how they influence form generation.[^3]

Turing[^4] and Wolpert[^5] established half a century ago that physico-chemical processes &mdash; reaction-diffusion systems and morphogen gradients, respectively &mdash; explain much developmental patterning. Healthy respect for the properties of solid objects in Euclidean 3-space &mdash; among them continuity, smoothness, and volume exclusion (by whose mandate we cannot walk through walls) &mdash; must underly morphological models. But the molecular biologist employs the graph to disentangle gene regulation. Physicists agree that ours is not Newton’s billiard-ball universe. Indeed to many a theory cannot tell us precisely what is, or how it came to be; only what it *does*. Cartwright cautions:

> The fundamental laws of physics do not describe true facts about reality. Rendered as descriptions of facts, they are false; amended to be true, they lose... explanatory force.[^6]

It is easy to forget, having received and consumed [Mazur's eggs](http://abel.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/preprints/when_is_one.pdf), that ham was on the menu; but matter and energy seem to manifest just a fragment of the kaleidoscope of causality. Sometimes, as Hofstadter puts it,

> the bottom level, though 100 percent responsible for what is happening, is nonetheless irrelevant to what happens.[^7]

Information is physical, says Landauer: it is subject to physical constraints.[^8] Likewise, the physical systems we call organisms are subject to informational constraints. The fundamental unit of terrestrial biology — which, as Bach[^9] and Brenner[^10] point out, looks quite like a self-replicating Turing machine, replete with read/write head and tape — is a vector for simultaneous spatial and temporal information transfer. Although plant cell identity seems primarily a result of location rather than lineage, Scheres reports,

> ancestral or neighboring cells can determine the fate of a given cell.[^11]

For Rosen, the future can too:

> [A] predictive model serves precisely to pull the future into the present.[^12]

To stand McLuhan[^13] on his head: maybe the message has hijacked the medium, encoding a strategy for self-regulation and -replication via exploitation of negentropy. Maybe some model nobody has conceived of yet would better serve us. But it is by no means clear that any model, known or not, can afford ontological certainty.

Some translations may remain infeasible only until appropriate methods are developed. Jonas and Kording, for instance, have shown modern neuroscience incapable of deriving the global function of a microprocessor from its underlying physical and logical structure:[^14] a feat we intuit should, in principle, be possible. But many other models likely cannot be reconciled by formal means. This doesn't mean we have to pick only one.

McMullin paraphrases Kuhn:

> ...later theories solve more puzzles than earlier ones, or (to put this in a different idiom) they predict better. But there is... no reason to think that successive theories approximate more and more closely to the truth.

Nonetheless

> [t]he values a good theory is expected to embody enable comparisons to be made, even when the rival theories are incommensurable.

He then argues this is too strong:

> Kuhn emphasized the discontinuities of language across theory change so strongly that he left no room for the possibility of convergence, for the possibility that the theories of paleontologists of today, for example, not only solve more puzzles than those of yesteryear but also tell us, with high degree of likelihood, what actually happened at distant epochs in the earth's past.[^15]

Maybe paleontology can claim "convergence" only because we intuitively grasp its object. We know how it feels (and many purport to know what it means) to live on planet earth. Though we have yet to locate a satisfactory definition of life, we are well equipped to talk about it &mdash; so long as we do not grasp unduly for details. But do we really understand what happened here long ago? How thoroughly do we comprehend what occurs here now? We discuss everyday objects and organisms with an ease which does not extend to tensors or topologies or transcription factors.

Penrose quips:

> I don't like the word materialist because it suggests we know what the material is.[^16]
