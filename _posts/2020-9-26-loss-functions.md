title: loss functions

Computer scientists and AI researchers from Minsky to Bostrom have considered the dangers of motivated, highly intelligent, non-human agents. We have lived among these for most, if not all, of recorded human history. What is a state, a corporation, or your local school's student government if not a suprahuman intelligence? We need not wait for some proto-AGI with an insufficiently nuanced loss function to observe the influence of beings larger than ourselves on our lives.

Why do so few make this connection explicit? Maybe they've never read William Gibson or leafed through an ecology text. Do they find obfuscation conducive to career success, or think their meaning clear despite its deliberately ambiguous object?
