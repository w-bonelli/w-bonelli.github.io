title: whatever really
---

> The relations that exist in the external world, and that govern their succession, collectively constitute what we call causality. Without a belief in causal order, there could be no science and, very probably, no sanity.[^1]

Science emerges from the conviction that reality is fundamentally ordered and therefore can be understood. To understand, we model — that is, we represent. Informed thusly, we act. It is our enduring hope that our models correspond, in some useful way, to whatever really is there; to whatever there really is. But what *is* there, really? And is there a single best way to model it?

In the Eulerian conception, the plant grows *in* space. In the Lagrangian, the plant *is* space, growing. In a third, “global growth results from the integration of growth tensors in space and time.” Prusinkiewicz and Runions warn that “one can never be certain that [one’s] model is valid, as its predictions may be contradicted by future experiments, and because different assumptions and models may lead to the same predictions.”[^2] This rings of Box and Luceno’s admonition: “any model is at best a useful fiction.” Happily, though, “enormous progress has been made by entertaining such fictions and using them as approximations.”[^3]

Can a single model exhibit explanatory power for all phenomena? Must there exist some “logical, implicative order”[^1] from which all else, in the broadest sense, can be derived? If so, is there cause to assume a *physical* theory of everything? Cartwright cautions: “The fundamental laws of physics do not describe true facts about reality. Rendered as descriptions of facts, they are false; amended to be true, they lose... explanatory force.”[^4] If this is true, it applies not just to physics but to all disciplines. Ought biological research programs then close ranks around — that is, adopt as a Lakatosian “hard core” — the idea that biology is strictly reducible to chemistry and physics? To put it another way: is it more reasonable to think there is nothing in biology which demands its own conceptual model, independent of physicochemical substrata, or to attempt to coax useful predictions from any ground sufficiently fertile to offer them?

Without doubt some measure of physicalism does remain indispensable to biological science. Deacon reminds us that “although the abstract logic of natural selection may be multiply realizable, selection is dependent upon substrate properties and how they influence form generation.”[^5] A healthy respect for the quotidian qualities of everyday 3-dimensional space — continuity, smoothness, volume exclusion — must underly morphological models. Turing[^6] and Wolpert[^7] established half a century ago that chemical processes — reaction-diffusion systems and morphogen gradients, respectively — explain a number of developmental patterns. And yet no modern molecular biologist denies that the graph, despite its abstract nature, is particularly useful in the study of transcriptional gene regulation. Physicists admit that we do not live in Newton’s universe. Matter, it seems, manifests just one fragment of the kaleidoscope of causality. Sometimes, as Hofstadter puts it, “the bottom level, though 100 percent responsible for what is happening, is nonetheless irrelevant to what happens.”[^8]

Information is physical, claims Landauer; that is, it is subject to physical constraints.[^9] Likewise, the class of physical systems we call living organisms are subject to informational constraints. The fundamental unit of terrestrial biology — which, as Bach[^2] and Brenner[^10] point out, looks quite like a self-replicating Turing machine, replete with read/write head and finite tape — is a vector for simultaneous spatial and temporal information transfer. These flows are only superficially orthogonal. Per Scheres, “ancestral or neighboring cells can determine the fate of a given cell.”[^11] Rosen argues that the *future* can too, by virtue of the cell’s internal model of its environment (a primitive one which, to be clear, implies nothing approaching cognition). In this formulation, “a predictive model serves precisely to pull the future into the present.”[^1]

To stand McLuhan[^12] on his head: perhaps the message has hijacked the medium, encoding a strategy for self-regulation and self-replication via exploitation of negentropy. Or maybe that's not quite right and some model nobody has conceived of yet would better serve us. Regardless, Brenner asserts, “at the core of everything are the tapes containing the descriptions to build these special Turing machines… The concept of the gene as a symbolic representation of the organism is a fundamental feature of the living world and must form the kernel of biological theory.”[^13]

This is not to say the gene is an appropriate abstraction in all biological contexts, but merely that bespoke abstractions — which may not be derived easily, if at all, from strictly physical and chemical processes — have proven and will in all likelihood continue to prove useful to the modeling of biological systems. In some cases derivations may appear possible in principle, but remain infeasible given the current state of the art, much in the same way Jonas and Kording demonstrated modern neuroscience incapable of deriving the global function of a microprocessor from its underlying physical and logical structure.[^14]

To Bach, Turing’s test is for us, not the machine.[^2] I agree. A constructivist mathematician will not accept the proof of some quantity until a function can be shown to yield it. Similarly, I think we will not understand life or intelligence until we can make it, if we can make it at all. In this way, the stated aims of synthetic biology and artificial intelligence appear to converge: to more and more elaborate manipulation, if not ultimately to synthesis, of living systems.

The former is often said to be untrodden territory, but it is not. The latter is. Many say both are dangerous. I wholeheartedly agree. I submit, however, that it is now more dangerous *not* to attempt the latter precisely because we have more or less unconsciously pursued the former for the last several thousand years.

This is not an enviable situation, but it is at least not a boring one.
