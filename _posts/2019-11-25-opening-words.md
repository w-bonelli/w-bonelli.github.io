The causalist, Hacking tells us[^2], is not as skeptical as Nietzsche. Like electrons, we can spray words at things with (somewhat) consistent results. I can type "Don't pay attention to your tongue" into the void and thus ensure you'll do the opposite.

Of complex systems, [Dijkstra posits](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD361.html):

> "...the number of levels that can be distinguished meaningfully... is kind of proportional to the logarithm of the ratio between the largest and the smallest grain."[^3]

In certain situations, claims Hofstadter,

> "the bottom level, though 100 percent responsible for what is happening, is nonetheless irrelevant to what happens."[^4]

His example is primes. Their nature &mdash; the strategy for their detection &mdash; is communicable regardless of transmission language and can be realized in silicon and grey matter alike.

How? It did not all begin between Euclid's ears. Perhaps with a grunt some hundred thousand years ago: humanity's first word, so to speak. Which one was that?

Some words are sharp: they have a point. Where? They point fingers. Cartwright cautions:

> “The fundamental laws of physics do not describe true facts about reality. Rendered as descriptions of facts, they are false; amended to be true, they lose... explanatory force.”[^5]

Per [Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong) and Lucěno,

> "any model is at best a useful fiction... Nevertheless enormous progress has been made by entertaining such fictions and using them as approximations."[^6]

Writes Morton:

> "The first task is to abolish the idea of the possibility of a metalanguage that could account for things while remaining uncontaminated by them... [but] some metaphors are better than others."[^7]

How to define the thing which must make up the definition? Nietzsche warned:

> "The 'thing in itself' is quite incomprehensible to the creators of language and not at all worth aiming for."[^1]

Heidegger tried anyway:

> "We are now no longer interpreting [X] in terms of [Y], nor comparing it with [Z]... Although we dealt directly with [X] itself &mdash; indeed precisely because of this &mdash; we have shirked in the face of [X]. We have indeed not spoken of other things... but of [X] yet not directly and concretely from *out of it*, but *about it*."[^8]

Marx, at least in his youth, held:

> "...the object itself must be studied in its development... [until it is] put alongside something else... [it] remains a mere abstract conception in space and does not develop into anything further.”[^9]

Maturana channels him and [Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law):

> "...the observer can describe an entity only if there is at least one other entity from which [they] can observe it to interact or relate. This second... can be any entity, but the ultimate reference for any description is the observer [them]self... the logic of the description and, hence, of behavior in general, is necessarily the logic of the describing system."[^10]

Derrida called his work an

> "'operation'... which, although it is consumed by the reading of other texts, in a certain fashion refers only to its own writing."[^11]

Formal systems are nearly as slippery as natural languages. Godel found their descriptions incomplete. Tarski proved them incapable of defining their motives. Poincare is reported to have said:

> "Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things."[^12]

Nietzsche, similarly:

> "...every concept originates through our equating what is unequal."[^1]

Where [Mazur writes](http://abel.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/preprints/when_is_one.pdf) "mathematical object", I have taken the liberty of substituting "thing":

> "To define the [things] we intend to study, we often &mdash; perhaps always &mdash; first make it understood, more implicitly than explicitly, how we intend these [things] to be presented to us, thereby delineating a kind of super-[thing]; that is, a species of [thing] garnished with a repertoire of modes of presentation. Only once this is done do we try to erase the scaffolding of the presentation, to say when two of these super-[things] &mdash; possibly presented to us in wildly different ways &mdash; are to be considered equal. In this oblique way, the [things] that we truly want enter the scene only defined as equivalence classes of explicitly presented [things]. That is, as specifically presented [things] with the specific presentation ignored, in the spirit of 'ham and eggs, but hold the ham.'"[^13]
