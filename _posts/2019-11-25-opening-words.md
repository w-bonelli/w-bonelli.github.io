Are words real?

Perhaps they are, you respond. Take fiction. One can hold it in one's hand. Look: here's a *Chronicles of Narnia*. C.S. Lewis was real, and so are his words, and so are his books. I own a few of them.

But what of the ideas? The characters? The worlds? Are they real?

Ah, now, surely not, you say. One shan't meet Aslan nor find Narnia no matter how many wardrobes one wanders into. Then again, one might encounter the good lion on an article of childrens' clothing, or a lunchbox. But fiction is born in the imagination, and what's imagined isn't real.

Well, I say, I'm stymied. Here before us lies a thing with which we decorate our children and their accessories. It's not real? It's all in one's head?

Don't be ridiculous, you may sputter. Of course it's real. Lewis thought about it, then wrote about it, then millions read him and thought about it some more. A film and plenty of profitable merchandise were made. Aslan the *idea* is real. Aslan the *lion* is not. On this we agree, yes?

Well, I might press, what's Aslan the *lion* if not an *idea*? at which point one might be forgiven for flying into a rage or, at least, abandoning the conversation.

Are words real?

The causalist, Hacking tells us[^2], might say yes. Like electrons, we can spray them at things with consistent results. For instance, I can spew "Don't pay attention to your tongue" into the void and thus ensure you'll do the opposite. Other things, like Yeti or *later* (as in, "I'll do it later"), aren't real, because we can't seem to locate or deploy them predictably. Where we can point to a cause, per this view, we can say a thing is real.

It took Faraday a lifetime to convince himself of the reality of the electromagnetic force[^2]. Isn't it proper that we entertain similar skepticism? Cartwright asserts:

> “The fundamental laws of physics do not describe true facts about reality. Rendered as descriptions of facts, they are false; amended to be true, they lose... explanatory force.”[^3]

Says Nietzsche:

> "What is a word? The image of a nerve stimulus in sounds."[^1]

Do words simply stand in for otherwise unmanageable complexity? Do words ever cause things to happen? Did you become aware of your tongue because I told you not to? Because some arcane symbols I arranged caused your neurons to fire in a peculiar way? Because the force-field ripples we call particles obeyed the rules physicists have so meticulously derived for them?

In certain situations, Hofstadter points out,

> "the bottom level, though 100 percent responsible for what is happening, is nonetheless irrelevant to what happens."[^4]

He goes on to ask how one might best explain a prime-finding algorithm. Is it best to outline the computational medium's mode of operation? Or to describe the nature of prime numbers and the essence of the strategy for their detection? For that matter, could one not object that the algorithm might not today be known were Euclid never to have discovered (or did he invent) primes?

Faraday did convince himself, in the end.[^2] [Tong puts it well](https://youtu.be/zNVQfWC_evg?t=804):

> "...this was Farraday's genius: to appreciate that, even though you can't see anything in between [two magnets] &mdash; even though, no matter how closely you look, the space between the magnets will seem to be empty &mdash; there's something real there."[^5]

Does knowledge rest necessarily on [constructs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construct_(philosophy)) measured by proxy? Of hierarchical systems, [Dijkstra posits](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD361.html):

> "...the number of levels that can be distinguished meaningfully... is kind of proportional to the logarithm of the ratio between the largest and the smallest grain."[^6]

How ought we determine whether the grains we observe correspond sufficiently closely to *real* things they purport to denote? Do we not increasingly negotiate and shape reality with language? How to avoid fallacies of reification? How to understand the various interwoven forms of vocalization, inscription, transmission, and computation which now surround us and have somehow blossomed from little more than a grunt some hundred thousand years ago?

[Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_models_are_wrong) and Lucěno contend that

> "...any model is at best a useful fiction... Nevertheless enormous progress has been made by entertaining such fictions and using them as approximations."[^7]

Affirms Morton:

> "The first task is to abolish the idea of the possibility of a metalanguage that could account for things while remaining uncontaminated by them... [but] some metaphors are better than others."[^8]

How ought one define the thing which itself must make up the definition? Nietzsche warned:

> "The 'thing in itself' is quite incomprehensible to the creators of language and not at all worth aiming for." [^1]

Heidegger tried anyway (here I conceal the object of his discussion, since it is the form which is of interest):

> "We are now no longer interpreting [X] in terms of [Y], nor comparing it with [Z]... Although we dealt directly with [X] itself - indeed precisely because of this - we have shirked in the face of [X]. We have indeed not spoken of other things... but of [X] yet not directly and concretely from *out of it*, but *about it*."[^12]

Marx, at least in his youth, held:

> "...the object itself must be studied in its development... [until it is] put alongside something else... [it] remains a mere abstract conception in space and does not develop into anything further.”[^9]

Maturana channels him:

> "...the observer can describe an entity only if there is at least one other entity from which [they] can observe it to interact or relate. This second... can be any entity, but the ultimate reference for any description is the observer [them]self."[^10]

Like [Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law), he maintains:

> "...the logic of the description and, hence, of behavior in general, is necessarily the logic of the describing system."[^10]

Derrida called his work an

> "'operation'... which, although it is consumed by the reading of other texts, in a certain fashion refers only to its own writing."[^11]

Words open to survey and close to scrutiny. What does one see when one looks at them? Accretion disks, sometimes: sensations or memories, slowly circling. Warped images from around and behind. They feed on &mdash; into &mdash; others of their kind. Some are sharp: they have a point. Where is it? They point fingers. Usually you're slung around between them. Occasionally you're sucked in and spit out. You're zipping along and then suddenly you're out of orbit and *here, now*. The page might swim. There's been a disturbance in the Force. You look back at what you read. It did something to you. You felt something move.

Formal systems, like natural languages, are shifty. Godel interrogated them and found their self-descriptions incomplete. Tarski proved them incapable of defining their motives. Said Poincare:

> "Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things."[^13]

Nietzsche, similarly:

> "...every concept originates through our equating what is unequal."[^1]

Where [Mazur writes](http://abel.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/preprints/when_is_one.pdf) "mathematical objects", I have (I think justifiably) substituted "words":

> "To define the [words] we intend to study, we often &mdash; perhaps always &mdash; first make it understood, more implicitly than explicitly, how we intend these [words] to be presented to us, thereby delineating a kind of super-[word]; that is, a species of [word] garnished with a repertoire of modes of presentation. Only once this is done do we try to erase the scaffolding of the presentation, to say when two of these super-[words] &mdash; possibly presented to us in wildly different ways &mdash; are to be considered equal. In this oblique way, the [words] that we truly want enter the scene only defined as equivalence classes of explicitly presented [words]. That is, as specifically presented [words] with the specific presentation ignored, in the spirit of 'ham and eggs, but hold the ham.'"[^14]

Words refract, I think. Some, like "red", twinkle in ways no one can precisely characterize except that they're *just so* &mdash; unless one feels that "the subjective quality of the visual experience of electromagnetic radiation with wavelength between 625 and 740 nanometers" is all there is to say about it.

In any case none emit light themselves. Things and beings do. Words bend it and slice it. Negative spaces emerge: distinctions. It's hard to see the lines, though. It's dark and the light flickers.
