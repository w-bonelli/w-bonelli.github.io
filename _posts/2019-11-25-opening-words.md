Words, to Hacking, are like electrons: we can spray them into the void with (sort of) consistent results.[^2] I can type "Don't pay attention to your tongue" and make you do the opposite.

How did it all begin? Maybe with a grunt some hundred thousand years ago: humanity's first word, so to speak. Which one was that?

Some words are sharp: they have a point. The

> movement of language through space... casts something into being that was not previously, or, put more surgically, excises something from where it once was.[^3]

When speech is recorded, per Galloway,

> [t]he air outside the microphone and the copper wire inside it do not form an identity because they are qualitatively different forms of materiality.

Still, something recognizable passes between two distinct modes of being: something bearing

> analogy and correspondence.[^4]

Some words point fingers. Writes Morton:

> The first task is to abolish the idea of the possibility of a metalanguage that could account for things while remaining uncontaminated by them... [but] some metaphors are better than others.[^5]

This sentence, per Place, is

> a cornucopia of concepts spun, like clouds of sugar, around a single stick.

Still it remains a

> [f]ailure to communicate... the fundamental condition of language[^6].

Nietzsche said the

> 'thing in itself' is quite incomprehensible to the creators of language and not at all worth aiming for.[^7]

Heidegger tried to define the thing which must make up the definition:

> We are now no longer interpreting [X] in terms of [Y], nor comparing it with [Z]... Although we dealt directly with [X] itself &mdash; indeed precisely because of this &mdash; we have shirked in the face of [X]. We have indeed not spoken of other things... but of [X] yet not directly and concretely from *out of it*, but *about it*.[^8]

Marx, at least in his youth, held that:

> the object itself must be studied in its development... [until it is] put alongside something else... [it] remains a mere abstract conception in space and does not develop into anything further.[^9]

Maturana channels him and [Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law):

> ...the observer can describe an entity only if there is at least one other entity from which [they] can observe it to interact or relate. This second... can be any entity, but the ultimate reference for any description is the observer [them]self... the logic of the description and, hence, of behavior in general, is necessarily the logic of the describing system.[^10]

Derrida called his work an

> 'operation'... which, although it is consumed by the reading of other texts, in a certain fashion refers only to its own writing.[^11]

Formal systems, like natural languages, are slippery. Godel found their statements inconsistent and their descriptions incomplete. Tarski proved them incapable of defining their motives. Poincare allegedly dubbed mathematics

> the art of giving the same name to different things.[^12]

Nietzsche, again:

> ...every concept originates through our equating what is unequal.[^7]

Did Deleuze have sets in mind &mdash; much of whose theory rests on the vacuous fact that, since one can never find an element of the empty set which is not in another set, all sets include the empty set &mdash; when he said reason is

> carved out... of delirium, and drift[^13]?

To construct a sentence, distinctions must be made. Some might call them arbitrary. They are, if nothing else, open to interpretation. Where [Mazur writes](http://abel.math.harvard.edu/~mazur/preprints/when_is_one.pdf) "mathematical object", one might substitute "thing":

> To define the [things] we intend to study, we often &mdash; perhaps always &mdash; first make it understood, more implicitly than explicitly, how we intend these [things] to be presented to us, thereby delineating a kind of super-[thing]; that is, a species of [thing] garnished with a repertoire of modes of presentation. Only once this is done do we try to erase the scaffolding of the presentation, to say when two of these super-[things] &mdash; possibly presented to us in wildly different ways &mdash; are to be considered equal. In this oblique way, the [things] that we truly want enter the scene only defined as equivalence classes of explicitly presented [things]. That is, as specifically presented [things] with the specific presentation ignored, in the spirit of 'ham and eggs, but hold the ham.'[^14]
