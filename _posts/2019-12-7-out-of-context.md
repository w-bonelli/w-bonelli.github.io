Attention is scarce and software is glue: it sticks to minds and bodies and itself. It gets kinky. Untangling knots is called "managing complexity". This is hard to do. It's made more difficult by the late profusion of mental and material machinery with which people program.

Software, like language, depends on context. On this nearly everyone agrees. The proper balance of implicit and explicit detail to hold in view at any one time, however, is hotly debated.

Some camps like to KISS: *Keep It Simple, Stupid*. This, they will admit, can put complicated shit in one's face. A tolerance for local complexity engenders global simplicity, it's said.

On the other side of the room clusters a ragged group, united only by a steadfast refusal to type more than necessary. Some of these, nursing a suspicion that something can be abstracted, have commandeered a whiteboard and drawn a network of neatly labeled objects and arrows.

One has the feeling there's an elephant in here. Its skin is a bit like a stubbornly wrinkled shirt: you can only keep one or two bits of it straight at once. Parts of it are prickly, and it won't go away.

Time presses through us always in the same direction: forward. Something up ahead sucks.

Large cohorts of scientists intermittently attach their names and reputations to documents which urge, more or less:

> If humankind does not dramatically alter its behavior, most or all of the planet may become uninhabitable.

Though this is not a paltry requisition, the usual business carries on.

Butler and Morton might both approve of it put this way: "being ecological", for contemporary human beings, is not an easy thing to be.

Wicked problems &mdash; global heating, plastic pollution, political corruption, institutional decay, psychological and economic warfare, state-sanctioned brutality, systemic racism, the [sixth mass extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction), SARS-CoV-2, the bacteriological arms race &mdash; are hard to think about. We live in them; they live in us.

In this warming web of stuff and life, what now?
