Attention is scarce and software is glue: it sticks to minds and bodies and itself. It gets kinky. Untangling knots is called "managing complexity". This is hard to do. It's made increasingly difficult by the late profusion of mental and material machinery with which people program&mdash;what, exactly?

One has the feeling there's an elephant in here. Its skin is a bit like a stubbornly wrinkled shirt: you can only keep one or two bits of it straight at once. Parts of it are prickly, and it won't go away.

Software, like language, depends on context. On this nearly everyone agrees. The proper balance of implicit and explicit detail to hold in view at any one time, however, is hotly debated.

Some camps like to KISS: *Keep It Simple, Stupid*. This, they will admit, can put complicated shit in one's face. A tolerance for local complexity engenders global simplicity, it's said.

On the other side of the room cluster several ragged groups. Some, nursing a suspicion that nobody truly disagrees after all, have commandeered a whiteboard and drawn a series of neat little labeled tubes.

Some few sullen or enigmatic types stand near the door. Perhaps these will not be retained by ping-pong and beer. One peers at you furtively.

"What's this?" you protest. "Why are we here? I must have missed something."

My mistake! I forgot to give you the context.

We live in a dewdrop on a blade of grass. Time presses through us always in the same direction: forward. Something up ahead sucks.

With increasing frequency, large cohorts of scientists attach their names and reputations to documents which urge, more or less:

> If humankind does not dramatically alter its behavior, most or all of the planet may become uninhabitable.

This is not a paltry requisition. Meanwhile the usual business carries on.

[Butler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Butler) and [Morton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Morton) might both approve of it put this way: "being ecological", for contemporary human beings, is not an easy thing to be.

Wicked problems tend to be things we're *inside*: like global heating, the bacteriological arms race, systems of institutional racism and state-sanctioned brutality, the [sixth mass extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction), or SARS-CoV-2. In this warming web of stuff and life we are not yet alone. What now?
