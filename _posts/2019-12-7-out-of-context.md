Attention is scarce and code is glue: it sticks to my fingers and my eyes and my mind.

Untangling knots is called "managing complexity". This is hard to do. It's made more difficult by the late profusion of mental and material machinery with which people program people and computers.

Software, like all language, depends on context. On this everyone agrees. The proper balance of implicit and explicit detail to hold in view at any one time, however, is hotly debated.

Some camps like to KISS: *Keep It Simple, Stupid*. This, they will admit, can put complicated shit in one's face. A tolerance for local complexity engenders global simplicity, it's said.

On the other side of the room clusters a ragged group, united only by a steadfast refusal to type more than necessary. Some of these, nursing a suspicion that something can be abstracted, have commandeered a whiteboard and drawn a network of neatly labeled objects and arrows.

One has the feeling there's an elephant in here. Its skin is like a stubbornly wrinkled shirt: you can only keep one or two bits straight at once.

Time presses through us always in the same direction: forward. Something up ahead sucks.

Large cohorts of scientists intermittently attach their names and reputations to documents which urge, more or less:

> If humankind does not dramatically alter its behavior, most or all of the planet may become uninhabitable.

Musk minces fewer words:

> We're really playing a crazy game here... We're taking vast amounts of carbon from deep underground and putting [it] in the atmosphere. This is crazy. We should not do this.[^1]

Butler and Morton might both approve of it put this way: "being ecological", for contemporary human beings, is not an easy thing to be.

We live inside wicked problems &mdash; global heating, economic and interpersonal inequity, systemic racism, plastic pollution, political corruption, institutional decay, physical and psychological warfare, state-sanctioned brutality, the sixth mass extinction, SARS-CoV-2, nuclear weapons and waste, the bacteriological arms race, soil erosion, ocean acidification, human migration &mdash; just as they live in us.

In this warming web of stuff and life, what now?
