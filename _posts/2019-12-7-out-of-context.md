> "The wish to found action on perfect insight means to nip it in the bud. Politics are action, always built on inadequate survey. But a world-view, too, is action; embracing the manifold universe is an anticipation of unpredictable efforts. In the end all our thinking depends on such inadequacies. We must advance, even without certainty! The only question is whether we are aware of it or not." - Otto Neurath

Attention is scarce and software is glue. It sticks: to minds and bodies and things. And to itself. It gets kinky. The art of untangling knots &mdash; there's no keeping them out &mdash; is called "managing complexity". This is hard to do. It's made increasingly difficult by the late profusion of people and computers and tools with which people program themselves.

Good jokes turn on grains of truth. Here's one: software engineers tend to secrete more complexity than they absorb. In this I am thus far no exception. Even so, the old tale about digging a moat for occupational security seems less true of the individual &mdash; though they certainly may be out there &mdash; than of the industry. Of industry itself, maybe.

Software, like language, depends on context. On this nearly everybody agrees. The proper balance of implicit and explicit detail to hold in view at any one time, however, is hotly debated.

Some camps like to KISS: *Keep It Simple, Stupid*. This tends, they will admit, to put complicated silliness in one's face. It's justified, asserts the KISSer, because there must exist local complexity in order to engender global simplicity. Boilerplate is usually better than bespoke abstractions.

On the other side of the room cluster several groups. Most, having had formal training in math, are a bit strange. All stand united by a steadfast refusal to type more than necessary. Some nurse a weaker conviction that complexity arises when simplicity is given undue priority.

Some few stand independent of the cliques. These are sullen or enigmatic types who will not be retained by ping-pong and beer. A couple have fallen asleep. Two more whisper between themselves about "trustless protocols" and "principles". One peers at you furtively.

"What's the deal?" you protest. "Why are we here? I must have missed something."

My mistake! I forgot to give you the context.

In a not-insignificant number of nations, working professionals regularly attend conventions wherein recent advancements, issues of concern, and industry standards &mdash; or, particularly in software, "workflow optimization": the ergonomics of our prosthetic fins and flippers, more or less &mdash; consume the attention of thousands of people for three to seven days. These events are often comfortable and occasionally lavish. Most are on-site: attendees fly in from all over the country or world.

Few bat an eye at this. Many circles consider it an essential form of networking. One wonders in passing whether perhaps this might not be the worst indulgence to hold remotely. But then again, someone's probably working on electric planes, and what's my drop in the bucket?

Some might justifiably object to what I've just said. I certainly feel ill-qualified to say it. I've done so not as a moral injunction nor because I find these events the most deserving target of ecologically-minded criticism &mdash; not by a long shot &mdash; but because

1. I've been to them (and so occupy no privileged critical stance), and

2. they bespeak the fact that to behavioral change cultural inertia often exhibits ambivalence or hostility.

Every decade or so (and with increasing rapidity, of late) massive cohorts of scientists attach their names and reputations to documents which urge more or less explicitly:

> If we don't get a grip, bad things will happen. Huge chunks of the planet &mdash; maybe all of it &mdash; could become uninhabitable.

This is not a paltry requisition. It is the planetary equivalent of crying "Fire!" in a crowded theater. Meanwhile the usual business marches on.

> "...vast numbers of people... [have] a low income, long commute and little career progression. Climate change will compound their difficulties, with increasing food prices and anxieties about the future. In such a context, it is unclear whether solidarity... will be a widespread response."

So claims Bendell. Morton posits in "agrilogistics" a far older demon. Denial, one often hears. I think both Morton and Butler would approve of it put this way: "being ecological", for most contemporary human beings, is not an easy thing to be.

We swim in a wrinkly, porous windshield. The air(row) we call time presses through us always in the same direction: forward. From behind. Something up ahead sucks.

As Morton points out, wicked problems tend to be things we're on the insides of: global heating, for example, or the bacteriological arms race. What's the medium? We are. We and an unthinkable mass of stuff and life. In this warming web of whatever it is we are not alone.

To anthropomorphize, most of the things and beings in the universe appear to care not a wit about the human condition. We, on the other hand, probably ought hereforward to care deeply for non-humans and humans alike if either are to thrive.

We live in a dewdrop on a blade of grass. An errant lump of rock and metal traveling 40 times the speed of sound could threaten it all tomorrow. So we peer into space with powerful telescopes and craft elaborate schemes to shatter the thing or push it out of the way. That's an easy problem, and a fun one (ever play *Asteroids*?). It's not so fun to squint forward in time and entertain the idea that one's kind is pushing one's planet to the brink of unlivability.

Resisting inertia is hard. It's not so difficult to imagine alternatives. What's hard is to pull out of one groove and into another. It's like climbing out of a hole. To disengage from a gravity well and skip out into the space between them, we execute controlled thrusts. Getting the trajectory right isn't easy, nor is coordinating all the little nozzles to point in the same direction.

We're like fish. Ponds dot the landscape. Maybe the one we're stuck in is stagnant and a little rancid. We can try to flop into another one &mdash; sort of *heave*, with the tail &mdash; but we're disadvantageously equipped for this sort of locomotion.

You know how the story goes, though. Fish grow legs.
