Attention is scarce and software is glue: it sticks to minds and bodies and itself. It gets kinky. Untangling knots is called "managing complexity". This is hard to do. It's made increasingly difficult by the late profusion of mental and material machinery with which people program&mdash; what, exactly?

One has the feeling there's an elephant in here. It's uneven and slippery, and parts of it are prickly, and it won't go away. Its skin is a bit like a stubbornly wrinkled shirt: you can only keep one or two bits of it straight at once.

Software, like language, depends on context. On this nearly everyone agrees. The proper balance of implicit and explicit detail to hold in view at any one time, however, is hotly debated.

Some camps like to KISS: *Keep It Simple, Stupid*. This, they will admit, can put complicated shit in one's face. A tolerance for local complexity engenders global simplicity, it's said. Boilerplate is better than bespoke abstraction.

On the other side of the room cluster several ragged groups. Some, nursing a suspicion that nobody truly disagrees after all, have commandeered a whiteboard and drawn a series of neat little labeled tubes.

Some few sullen or enigmatic types stand near the door. Perhaps these will not be retained by ping-pong and beer, or perhaps they will. One peers at you furtively.

"What's this?" you protest. "Why are we here? I must have missed something."

My mistake! I forgot to give you the context.

We live in a dewdrop on a blade of grass. Time presses through us always in the same direction: forward. Something up ahead sucks.

In a not-insignificant number of nations, working professionals regularly attend conventions wherein a variety of topics &mdash; recent advancements, industry standards, the ergonomics of the discipline's material and mental prosthetics &mdash; consume the attention of thousands of people for three to seven days.

With increasing frequency, large cohorts of these same people &mdash; many of them scientists, who for utterly defensible reasons fly regularly to and from conferences &mdash; attach their names and reputations to documents which urge, more or less:

> If humankind does not dramatically alter its behavior, most or all of the planet may become uninhabitable.

This is not a paltry requisition. Meanwhile the usual business carries on.

> "...vast numbers of people... [have] a low income, long commute and little career progression. Climate change will compound their difficulties, with increasing food prices and anxieties about the future. In such a context, it is unclear whether solidarity... will be a widespread response."[^1]

[So claims Bendell](https://jembendell.com/2019/11/05/will-we-care-enough-to-matter-to-them-climate-justice-solidarity-and-deep-adaptation/). Morton posits in "agrilogistics" a far older demon.[^2] Maybe he and Butler would approve of it put this way: "being ecological", for contemporary human beings, is not an easy thing to be.

Wicked problems tend to be things we're *inside*: like global heating, the bacteriological arms race, systems of state-sanctioned police brutality, or SARS-CoV-2. In this warming web of stuff and life we are not alone. What now?
