Some speak of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264714915_Simples_and_Gunk">gunk</a>.[^1] Gunk is compelling: it's a bit punk. Gunk, one thinks, has kinks.

Kinks won't fold or cut cleanly &mdash; they're bent into shape. Is a kink gunk that knits itself, like [Escher's planes](https://uploads3.wikiart.org/images/m-c-escher/twon-intersecting-planes-colour.jpg)? For Morton

> [i]t is not that objects primordially “occupy” some existing region of spacetime, but that they are caught in the fields of, and otherwise “spaced” and “timed” by other entities.[^2]

Foliations &mdash; pictures strung together into movies &mdash; are familiar: maybe especially so for this

> generation... for whom time has always come ready-cut into digital micro-slices.[^3]

We often tend to think, more or less unconsciously, in terms of time-indexed state evolution through space. Some have begun to speak seriously, however, of "indefinite causality": a potential bridge between gravity and the standard model.[^4] Causal pluralism, lignified only under composition? What this would make of art or science is not yet clear.
