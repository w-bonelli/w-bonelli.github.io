title: an ideology

> Ideology is a sick fetish.[^1]

Here is expressed what might be called an ideology&mdash;not quite un-ideology. Un-*teleology*, maybe.

He who was before all else a revolutionist wrote:

> The philosophers have only interpreted the world... the point, however, is to change it.[^2]

Indeed. The nib of a pen, suffusing the [remains of an animal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parchment) with the [remains of a vegetable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_gall_ink), can hardly do otherwise. One takes issue only with "only".

Ballpoints and blockchains beget milder revolutions than bombs and bayonets. Whether this constitutes an improvement is disputed. To Calasso, the

> invisible, imperceptible sun of political action [is now] not to impede or foster... convulsions... but rather to *soften the blow*, to coat the sharp edges in sweet essence of balm... [and] above all to... refuse to credit them with that *extra something* which they always claim to represent &mdash; to refuse to believe, in short, that a massacre can easily be transformed into a sacrifice.[^3]

Bombs still drop, to be sure, but only elsewhere: a place which tends to produce most of the most militant revolutionaries.

The modern American war engine was born of anti-fascism: contra those who had watched what went on in the American south, and taken notes.

Fascism was defeated, but Bolshevism &mdash; that is, Stalin's revision of it, and all the revisions after that &mdash; followed closely behind. When it too fell, terror emerged; usually from elsewhere. Next the sheen of justice sheathed the blade of the state.

The 45th president of the United States did not don the rags of his predecessors, and empire wore no clothes.

Will we redress it? Will we re-dress it?
