An ideology: un-ideology, almost.

One who was before all else a revolutionist wrote:

> The philosophers have only interpreted the world... the point, however, is to change it.[^2]

Did he fail to see the nib of his pen, suffusing the [remains of an animal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parchment) with the [remains of a vegetable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_gall_ink)? The issue is only with "only".

Ballpoints and blockchains beget milder revolutions than bombs and bayonets. Whether this constitutes an improvement is disputed. To Calasso, the

> invisible, imperceptible sun of political action [is now] not to impede or foster... convulsions... but rather to *soften the blow*, to coat the sharp edges in sweet essence of balm... [and] above all to... refuse to credit them with that *extra something* which they always claim to represent &mdash; to refuse to believe, in short, that a massacre can easily be transformed into a sacrifice.[^3]

Bombs still drop, to be sure, but only elsewhere: a place which tends to produce most of the most militant revolutionaries.

This country's war engine was born of anti-fascism&mdash;contra those who had watched what went on in the American south, and taken notes.

Fascism was defeated, but a different revisionism followed closely behind. When it too fell, terror emerged; usually from elsewhere. Next the sheen of justice sheathed the blade of the state.

45 did not don the rags of respectability, and empire wore no clothes.

Will we redress it? Will we re-dress it?
