An erstwhile thought on a patchwork plane: reality is only flat until the screen shatters.

Technology continues to totalize. The cosmopolitan class slew stability for mobility's sake decades ago. Its present archetype, the [programmer-priest of the post-political age](https://www.c-span.org/video/?478048-1/facebook-twitter-ceos-testify-senate-judiciary-committee), is [Captain Sparrow in the big wheel](https://youtu.be/k2C68Nh-ltQ?t=227).

Cronus swallowed the world &mdash; that is, trawled, butchered, and brokered the planet, its people, and, more recently, the information-scape swaddling them &mdash; and belched. Soon his stomach will split; whether rent by some son's hand or by Gaia herself, who can yet say?

Code can't catabolize civic consciousness forever. Nor can we compute away collapsing infrastructure, a generation sentenced to debt, dependence, and decline, an excess of carbon in the atmosphere, or the erosion of arable land across the national breadbasket (and any consequent paucity in the grain silos).

There was at least one contradiction in the dead materialist enterprise: it could not consistently provide for its people. The live one, at least in America, seems nearly to have forgotten to.
