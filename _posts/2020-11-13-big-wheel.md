Technology continues to totalize. The cosmopolitan class slew stability for mobility's sake decades ago. Its present archetype, the [programmer-priest of the post-political age](https://www.c-span.org/video/?478048-1/facebook-twitter-ceos-testify-senate-judiciary-committee), is [Captain Sparrow in the big wheel](https://youtu.be/k2C68Nh-ltQ?t=227).

A new Cronus swallowed the world &mdash; trawled, butchered, and brokered its information-scape &mdash; and belched. Will his stomach split, rent by some son's hand or mother herself?

Code can't catabolize civic consciousness forever. Nor can we compute away collapsing infrastructure, a generation sentenced to debt, dependence, and decline, an excess of carbon in the atmosphere, or the erosion of arable land across the national breadbasket (and any consequent paucity in the grain silos).
