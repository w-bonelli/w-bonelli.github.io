An erstwhile thought on a patchwork plane: reality is only flat until the screen shatters.

Capital continues to totalize, but the programmer-priest of the post-political age, more transparently than ever, is Captain Sparrow in the big wheel. There is not just one plateau, after all:

> Never believe that a smooth surface will save us.[^1]

Cronus has swallowed the souls of the world &mdash; that is, trawled, butchered, and brokered the planet's information-scape &mdash; and belched. Soon his stomach will split; whether rent by some son's hand or by Gaia herself, who can yet say?

Software cannot catabolize civic consciousness forever. Nor can we compute away collapsing infrastructure, a generation sentenced to debt, dependence, and decline, an excess of carbon in the atmosphere, or the erosion of arable land across the national breadbasket (and any consequent paucity in the grain silos).

One insurmountable contradiction in the great dead materialist enterprise was that it could not provide for its people. The live one, at least in America, seems to have forgotten to.
