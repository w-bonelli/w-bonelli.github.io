An erstwhile thought on a patchwork plane: reality is only flat until the wall the screen is mounted on bursts in.

Capital may be totalizing, but the ground moves. The priest of the post-political age is, more transparently than ever, Captain Sparrow on the big wheel. There is not just one plateau, after all:

> Never believe that a smooth surface will save us.[^1]

Hordes of engineering graduates in the United States flock each year to (social) media giants or Beltway consultancies &mdash; that is, to the money, although there is probably less around this year than usual &mdash; where they learn to wear glassy faces like the buildings they work in. I would know; I was one of them.

What do they do, one wonders? Protect the nation? Connect the globe? Innovate? Maybe cybersecurity, or trawling and brokerage of the planet's information-scape, or playing whack-a-mole with propaganda mills trying to swing elections in purportedly democratic nations, or just networking state DMVs (like me)?

Information technology may have eaten political control (read: automated population segmentation and (semi-)conscious (self-)policing of thought) and maybe even warfare (the same, applied elsewhere), but we will not be able to compute away collapsing infrastructure, a generation sentenced to debt and decline, an excess of carbon in the atmosphere, or the erosion of arable land across the national breadbasket (and any consequent paucity in the grain silos).

The great dead materialist enterprise could not provide for its people. The live one, at least its American incarnation, seems nearly to have forgotten to.
