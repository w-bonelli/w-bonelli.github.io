An erstwhile thought on a patchwork plane: reality is only flat until the screen shatters.

Capital continues to totalize, but the earth shudders beneath it. The cosmopolitan class slew stability for mobility's sake decades ago. Its present archetype, the programmer-priest of the post-political age, is Captain Sparrow in the big wheel. Progress, perhaps, has found its final plateau.

Cronus swallowed the souls of the world &mdash; that is, trawled, butchered, and brokered the planet's information-scape &mdash; and belched. Soon his stomach will split; whether rent by some son's hand or by Gaia herself, who can yet say?

Software cannot catabolize civic consciousness forever. Nor can we compute away collapsing infrastructure, a generation sentenced to debt, dependence, and decline, an excess of carbon in the atmosphere, or the erosion of arable land across the national breadbasket (and any consequent paucity in the grain silos).

One insurmountable contradiction in the great dead materialist enterprise was that it could not provide for its people. The live one, at least in America, seems to have forgotten to.
